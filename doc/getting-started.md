# Getting started

Operations Center is available as an application on
[IncusOS](https://linuxcontainers.org/incus-os/docs/main/), or can be run on
most Linux distributions. The CLI and UI can be run on any of Linux, MacOS, or
Windows.

See the [Contributing](contributing.md) page for more information on building
